      const InboxTxt = `Since our site specializes in the Adult niche or to put it simply we work in the field of
we can conclude that from time to time we will come across men who
who want to chat, in simple terms, pornographers.
They are here to talk about their fantasies and so on. There are sites that
specialize only in this kind of chatting, like OnlyFans.
On our site there are about 20-40% of such men, how many depends on the temperament of the
of the operator and the beauty of the profile.
Top employees always conduct correspondence in the “Flirt” mode, make responses in this style
and write newsletters in this style to attract the serious and the vulgar at once.
This is a very important phrase that you need to remember, I'll say between the lines, but the more
flirtatious, positive in your mailings, the more loyal men are to you.
Closer to the point, what to do if a man wrote us a letter with vulgarity?
The site only allows us to write explicit letters to our favorites, men who have not been
corresponded with, our “online” men should not receive such letters.
It's even easier to reply to a man, we can slur whatever we want and talk about anything
anything. If a man writes us a porn letter, we need to answer him the same way and ask him
a couple more questions on a topic he or she is interested in, maybe attach a good photo as well.
New employees are often confused about the best way to write and that they are
shy to do it, but that goes away, it's just as much a part of the job as any other.
as any other part of the job. It's especially important to realize that these men are much more likely to write letters
and much quicker to respond because we get them hot.

Now we need to talk about how to work with vulgarity and how to twist it in the right direction to get maximum results.
to maximize results.
To do this we need to understand the framework.
- In online mailings (new men) - can not vulgarity in any form, but a light flirtation
will do.
- On mailing lists inbox (favorites) - by permission of the administrator, but flirting is always allowed.
- In replies - you can vulgarize in any way and always, as long as the client is satisfied.
Newsletters on inbox.
“My swimsuit is really tight, do you want to see how small it is on me?”
“I bought red panties but I don't have anyone to wear them for, can I show them to you?”
“I've never been in the shower with anyone, I feel stupid writing this to you, should I take the
the phone with you now?”
The difference is in the details and clarification, we write on inboxes more directly about it.


Bottom line.
The vulgar are our rich clients who can write a lot. They're part of the job and they can be
sometimes turn them into regulars and serious correspondence.
In replies to a man, we can vulgarize as much as we like.
Flirting - it is better to use always and be a positive, open and even frivolous
girl, as for these men the world through rose-colored glasses and for them it is the norm!

      const ReplyTxt = `We can talk forever about how to answer letters, what to write and so on, but there is no sense in it. In this text I will highlight only the main points that you need to know as a mantra for men to send back letters. Be sure to talk to a man as a person, if you do not like something about him - then tell him about it (wisely), it on the contrary ignites interest. Do everything as a real girl would do Need to make compliments, but only not banal "you're handsome" and so on. We see an old car in his picture, look at the model of the car and say that he has great taste. That kind of thing is more memorable than the fact that he's handsome. Grandfather in 70 years old realizes that his best and beautiful years are gone, do not deceive so openly :) One of the most important things, a man in any case needs a perspective, you need to keep the history of the meeting so that in the future the man saw that this correspondence will go to the real level! 
And in reality, 80% of men on the site are afraid to meet! The answer to the man should be on EVERY question, and the dialog should always be continued, but not with questions "how was your day", and questions on the topic. Writes a man for the fact that he is now drawing drawings for the titanic - write him questions about the titanic. 
Correspondence with 99% of men on the site stands on 3 big elephants that should be added to every letter, it is: meeting, flirting, tired of the site Bottom line: make our answers interesting, touch on the topics of flirting and meeting, answer every question and ask leading questions in response, this is the key to the fact that your regulars will stay with you. Now let's talk about the work with meeting men. The site is against the fact that we fool men and say that we will be tomorrow, for such things you can get a fine. The management of Drim can be understood, if everyone said that they would be tomorrow, there would be no men left on the site. But what is the algorithm of actions when a man writes about the meeting? If wrote metchnik there are 3 basic rules: 1) Do not give him an instant refusal (I can not meet, I have a problem, I do not know), we need to say "yes, I want and very much, but....." and after but we do a "pad", the thing we need to do to see him, the better and not banal "pad" the better. 2) Demonstrate interest in the meeting, ask him a flurry of questions that need a girl to meet him! Need to make it clear that the meeting is more important to you than to him! 3) Never call specific dates, remember, you can not say: "I will definitely be at your place on August 23rd" "I will come next week" "Next weekend I will be in Miami at your place" Need to say: "I think I can be at your place already in August" "I am finishing something and will be with you" "I have to tell you in a couple of days news about our meeting" Now about the pad to the questionnaire. 
This pad should be not banal, no one you should not be sick, no problems banal with documents should not be and so on. We look first of all at the questionnaire. 

Basic rules:
1. Do not refuse immediately and categorically (I can't, we don't know each other that well, etc.).

2. demonstrate your interest in the meeting, make it clear that you also want it.

3. do not say specifics (dates, time, plans)

If it is a long correspondence and the man is already talking about the meeting directly, then support him in his plans, offer several options for what you can do during these meetings (go to the dolphinarium, visit an unusual restaurant, fly in a hot air balloon, etc.). But don't say that you 100% will, after a while of such discussions you can come up with some pity story. For example, grandma has suspicions of a serious illness and has to be with her and undergo an examination, or (forget this phrase! men do not believe in it anymore)

she's being sent on a job to another branch in some backwater.
she has not yet decided to tell her parents and needs time to do so (for young girls)
there is a turbulent situation in the country and the girl is very worried about the safety of the man (especially relevant for girls from Russia or Donbass, you can say that she will try to come to him herself)
she is not feeling well (poisoned by something, or a strong flu).
But you can talk about this only after the man sees your interest, otherwise you risk losing him. Dose the information. It is not necessary to tell all the details, let the man is also worried and waiting, let it be as realistic as possible. The more emotions, the better. So you will not get confused in your story and will be able to postpone the meeting for more than one month.



If a man writes to you for the first time and leaves his number and address
then you need to do the same thing. If it is a letter, then you should reply as soon as possible, because most likely he writes this message to many girls in the hope that at least someone will agree to meet. For example, you can write that the girl works not far from his place of residence, so he feels that they have more opportunities to meet. Then you need to ask more about him, about where he would like to visit in the city, what he has already seen, how he likes to spend his time... then find out how long he will be in the city, and say that she is now for example at a conference (on a business trip) and will return shortly before his departure. If you say that she will be busy all the time, then most likely the man will not continue to communicate, you need to give him hope that the meeting will take place. And then it will be impossible to just stay late and meet, but it is necessary to tell the man how sorry the girl is about it and how much she is upset... You can tell him how she planned this meeting, etc.


Remember that very often men are loyal to the fact that at the moment the girl can not meet him. The main thing is not to panic and do not scare the man categorical refusal. Create intrigue, the illusion of meeting. It should be interesting to communicate with the girl. Also if you are sure that the man will understand correctly, you can write that she had a negative experience in past relationships and now she does not want to rush.

Many men subconsciously do not want to meet, so if you give them a reasonable and realistic reason why she can not meet him at the moment, there is a high probability that communication will continue on the site. He will continue to idealize the girl, which won't happen if he is disappointed in her when he meets her, as not many girls are willing to work well at meeting.


!!!A man must always get an answer to all his questions in a letter and see the
the girl's interest; you must read where he lives, what he likes to ask a question about what the
the weather in Chicago or what movie he made when he was directing. And also show him
the prospect that you want to see him in real life.!!!

- Your newsletters and replies should match, if a girl is going to Paris in 2 weeks, then
try to write more about it. If she's in a bad mood, then it's bad in the replies and in the
in the mailings, but try to always be positive, of course.
- Always add a little flirtation to replies and newsletters and try to act “lighthearted”,
a hardened man, a veteran of this life, certainly not here to be burdened
with incomprehensible things, he is already looking for fun and calm, sometimes of course “brainteasers”, but far not
always, you have to keep a balance.
- You need to understand who your profile is, what he does, what he is looking for. With that, you'll get
a lot more ideas for mailings and profits.

A few examples. Girl Francesca 28 years old, lives in Venesuella, pad - afraid that in the U.S. beat immigrants and therefore afraid to come to a man without guarantees Girl Ira 40 years old, lives in Kiev, pad - she has a court with her husband about the child and until it is not finished, will not be able to meet! Here are such pads are needed! Bottom line: meeting afraid - do not need to, about this even mailing lists should be written to fuel the interest of men! And do it constantly, but without promising anything immediately!

      const LetterBotTxt = `In general, you need to realize that for a good balance on the form, you need 5-10 regulars or
or just receive 1 letter per hour during the day, and it is already 550$ salary per month. If you run
2 of these profiles, that's 1100$. But on the top questionnaires on which employees with experience,
the results are always higher. But you and I are beginners and we need to focus on how to get these
regulars.
It all starts with mailings, and retention with the same mailings but with good responses.
First rule: “In online mailings, we lure a man to the first response with any kind of
provocation, and in mailings on inboxes we write always positive, use flirting and write about
about the girl and her life.”
You have to have a personality, we don't write the first newsletter about “do you like books” and the
“I like to walk in the park”, why would that be of interest to our client?
Do you think men at 50+ think about that? Of course not.
Our clients need to see the prospect of meeting a girl, that she's a real person,
see real flirting, intelligent questions, read about her life in general, and he expects that
you're going to replace that online relationship that he's missing.
The second rule: “You need to know who your girlfriend works for, what she likes, when she goes to the
showers in the morning and what she needs in a man to bang his brains out sometimes, simply put.
you have to get into character to know how to write a newsletter.”
All of these ideas that we'll be putting on our character you can get from your
administrator


You just have to do the norm on mailings and write provocative letters on the
LetterBot or the online newsletter. WITH THE MOST FUCKED-UP,
ENTICING BEGINNING. This category of mailing is crucial for one simple reason.
simple reason. In a few days of good mailings, you can build up a large list of
of reids (email opens) and men will start getting MORE emails from you. On this
we will already increase the chance of finding new regulars.
TOTAL: A good number of letterbots and a GREAT BEGINNING IN LETTERBOTH.
FOR A MAN TO OPEN A LETTER


Now we will talk about the topics for these newsletters and it is necessary to realize that it is better not to
write newsletters directly on this topic, from each individual idea you can make 10-20 child ideas and this is the best way to do it.
10-20 child ideas and that's the best way.

1) Doubts in a man.
Do not forget that the girl in any case the main role, she must doubt the
man, if you will immediately flatter, say “I love can not”, it will take away the interest in the
at the root.
Examples:
- Are you really here for a serious relationship?
- Would you have written me first if I hadn't?
- Are you ready to leave this site with me or are you already attached to it?
- Are you real?
- Do you have a real name and data on this site?
- What happens if this site closes? How will we communicate?
2) Photography Newsletters.
We look through the girl's gallery and look for interesting photos that make sense or
just that caught your eye, then just a little thinking and think of what kind of
question you can add to them.
Examples:
- (a photo somewhere in another country) have you been here? What about a vacation together?
- (photo in dress) what do you think of me in this dress? You're not gonna give me
even a compliment?
- Do you have a car? Honestly, it drives me crazy when I see a man
a man drive.
- (photo with a smile) Is this the photo I took for you today? Maybe you could
could you send me a picture of yourself finally?
3) Provocations.
Any provocative mailings are best on new men and usually with a
good beginning of the letter (first sentence) they can bring more responses. В
mailings of experienced employees, provocations are at least 40% of the total number of mailings
Examples:
- You won't freak out if I want a meeting within a week?
- Can I be sure you're not just an “internet hero”? All men are always
very smart with words.
- You want to know when I lied to you?
- Tell me honestly, you're not on this site to meet me, are you?
- You're just here to look at pictures of pretty girls in bikinis?
- Are you afraid of open-minded women like me?
- Are you a real man or not?
4) Flirting
Flirting should be written properly and every flirting mailing we put only after
administrator's approval, it's a very subtle topic, but it's a very popular one. Remember?
Examples:
- (waist photo) you have no idea how I feel when I picture
your hands on my waist.
- Do you have pictures you can only show me?
- How can we test our attraction to each other if we're on this site?

- I'm having so much trouble picking out a bikini, can you help me?
- I want you to see me now, guess where I am.
5) Encounter.
Meeting themes are something you should use daily, even if a man is the most
the latest slut, he's still hoping for a meeting (or just imagining it in his
in his head.) We have to show a man perspective every day.
Immediately a small remark, everyone should have “his” story of meeting on the form, it is
may be a direct meeting, may be on vacation, may be after a girlfriend
gives birth because she needs help, maybe after the stupid boss stops
at work and so on and so forth.
The main thing is never to say in the mailings “I will definitely come next week”, “I
WANT TO MEET YOU NOW”, as well as, you should not call clear and always use ‘if’.
use “if.”
Examples:
- Where do you see us meeting?
- Can I be sure you're not a scammer and that you're serious?
- What if we meet with you and my friend so that I feel safe?
safe?
- What are your plans for the next month, maybe I can be your plan?
- Is it still possible to get refugee status in your country?
- Do you see us meeting as just a date or moving in together right away?
- And a million other document-related topics to make it easier to understand,
put yourself in the shoes of your profile and ask the question, “How do I even get there
to this stranger?”

6) Appearance.
Doubting your appearance to get a compliment from a man also
work
Examples:
- Do you want me to enlarge your lips?
- My friend had her breasts enlarged, and now I don't know how to live with my size.
size.
- What about the color of my hair? Maybe blondes drive you crazier than me.
я?
And so on.

      const FlirtTxt = `A newsletter is an appeal to our target audience, and the target audience is usually a bit sad and boring characters. Accordingly, to get answers we need to ALWAYS do newsletters with FLIRT, humor and DETAILS.
              I ask you to memorize this as a mantra and repeat to yourself every single day that this is what you need to write about.
      By the way, for general education, in the USA it is not even customary to talk to each other about negativity and so on, so we try to always write with positivity, even if you write so badly.


      First let's start with flirting, how to write flirting not to violate the rules of the site.
      - Do not add vulgar details in terms of "I will now do with you this and this and you with me this and that".
      - be careful with photos, so that they do not show nipples and so on (swimsuits and the rest can be).

      Flirting should be reasonable.
      I will show examples of different beginnings of letters with a hint of flirting (further in them we translate the subject)




      want your fingers be able not just to type honey))) Seriously)))
      I need you to grab my hand and DO SOMETHING SPECIAL for yourself... She just said to me that I look like a LESBIAN!
      Male's size is it a reason of female's hapiness?
      Big and hot STEAK or ME????
      Kisses, touches or even more??? Such a fruit like me deserves YOU?

      Then from these ideas we continue to write newsletters and even if we wrote about fingers at the beginning of the letter, we can turn the topic to a variety of things!
      Such things should be done as often as possible, your letters will be better noticed and your chance to start a conversation with a potential regular will be much higher!!!!


      Now let's talk a little bit about the details in the letter and what is the main mistake of almost all beginning translators!!!!

      When you write a newsletter, you have to realize that it's been written 100 times before you and it needs to be wrapped in details that will make it unique and interesting. You can't just take the topic "what do you think about breast augmentation" and write that question directly. You need to add details, why are you asking it? What kind of answer do you need to get? And so on.

      Now let's take 2 examples, a typical newsletter of a newbie on this topic and a newsletter of an already experienced employee with a good balance.




      ROOKIE
      Dear, what do you think about breasts implants?
      So many girls nowadays are trying to increase their breasts and I think really a lot last time about it. Tell me please, would it looks good on me?
      What do you think if I will do it soon? Would you like me more?
      Your Ivanna


      EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEE
      are implants really sexies than natural shape?
      My female friend Evgenia always says that she has no regrets because she made implants in

      her breasts, she got about 2 sizes extra and she got more confidence in herself and her husband STARTED TO SMILE FINALLY! HAHAHHAHAHAHA
      I'm not joking, after she did it, I've finally noticed that he is smiling on photos! Is it a

      coincidence??))))
      But what about you??

      Would you smile with me always or I need to change something? Your Ivanna


      What's the difference:
      - The girl cited a situation from her life
      - She wrote with humor.
      - Added emoticons.
      - The beginning is better than the first newsletter, it's intriguing.
      - There are capslock on sentences that are worth paying attention to.
      - There are details, like the fact that the increase by 2 sizes, the fact that her husband started smiling afterwards, etc.

      Overall the newsletter looks 3 times more lively. It's better to write 1 of these than 100 first drafts, don't you agree?


      The third is humor, this is the easiest, to come up with something funny just try to imagine how to laugh vulgar grandfather, this phrase itself is already funny, I personally add humor in newsletters very often and it makes the newsletter 100 times livelier.

      To understand how to make humor is easier then reduce the newsletters to the simplest and banal, questions from stupid publicks that were in 2014-2017, like daivinchik and so on.

      To make it even clearer, one phrase will help and the crown newsletter on the theme "you would wipe my ass if I broke both arms"
      All newsletters in this tone always come on hurrah, if not from the first time then from the second time for sure!

      The main thing is not to whine, do not write banal and do not try to write advertising, you need to be a person, you need to make a beautiful and interesting manner of communication, only so you can make a salary of 1000-1400 + dollars!
